## Interest Calculator Kata


Problem solving so far:

 /calculate/ API returns calculations, based on provided parameters:
 - initial savings amount
 - interest rate
 - monthly deposit (assuming not a month is missed)
 - clculation period ( for example, next 50 years)
 - Paid Interest Interval in months. Options are  monthly, quarterly ( every 3 month) or annually (every 12 month)

Front end:
- fetches data inside the App component, (mvp, hardcoced values)
- sets proxy route to map front-end to back-end /calculate/ route. 

Next Steps:
- there is a lot of front end left to address - passing the input values up and down the component tree to render graph onChange
- some styling refactoring required to seperate the concerns in a better way
- Please see my previous front-end katas done recently to gage front-end capacity, as I feel in this kata it hasn't been addressed enough:

Blockers:
- time dedicated to this challenge was around 4 hours
- blocker which took more time than expected was to resolve proxy mapping : localhost front-end to back-end address route calling. The mistake was to atempt a quick heroku-app deployment while not noticing the existing API.js. 



Python & Django setup

* Install `python3` via brew
* Clone the repo
* cd into repo
* Install `virtualenv` using `pip3` (think yarn)

```sh
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

* Create a virtualenv for the project

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```

If you're having trouble completing this step, try upgrading virtualenv first `pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv`

* Activate the virtualenv

```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install dependencies in the new virtualenv

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

* Server should be running at http://localhost:8000


 ## Client setup

 * cd into `frontend` and run `yarn install`

 * Run `yarn start`. 

The webapp should now be running at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€


## The challenge

Create a web-app that shows how much you can expect to make from your savings
over time.

The app must satisfy the following Acceptance Criteria (ACs):

* It should allow the user to vary the initial savings amount, monthly deposit and interest rate through the UI
* It should display how much the user's initial savings amount will be worth
  over the next 50 years, to a monthly precision. This should assume that the monthly amount is paid in each month, and the value rises with the interest rate supplied.
* It should allow the user to select how often interest is paid - either 'Monthly', 'Quarterly' or 'Annually'
* All calculations must take place server-side, and all monthly projection data should be returned via an endpoint
* The calculations must be triggered onChange of any input, to give live feedback on the input data. The performance (try the slider) should be reasonable.
* You can use any tech stack on the client you like to manage app state and server communication (e.g. Redux with Thunk/Saga/other API client, Relay/Apollo/GraphQL etc.)
